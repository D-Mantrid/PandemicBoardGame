PROJECT TITLE: Joe's pandemic project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT 
This is some java code I've written in BlueJ to try and simulate the boardgame pandemic (or at least a simplified version of it).

It should when ran create a game with a few players who will make automatic choices about what to do until the game is either won or lost.

VERSION or DATE:
12th December 2018.

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:
I use the commands given in either 2playertest.txt or 4playertest.txt


AUTHORS: Joe Salmon

USER INSTRUCTIONS: You will need to play around with the location of the file "cities.csv" I think to get the program to find it. Also I think that having written this in BlueJ it will need beefing up to actually run in a JVM.
